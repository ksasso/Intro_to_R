Data Science Projects: Tidy Workflow Essentials

![R for Data Science - Garrett Grolemund & Hadley Wickham](https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/571b056757d68e6df81a3e3853f54d3c76ad6efc/32d37/diagrams/data-science.png)

### What is Tidy Data?

**Tidy**

Data that is in a format optimized for visualization and modeling so that you can examine your hypotehses of interest

- Each column is a variable
- Each row is an observation

**Transform**

Further prep that allows you to narrow in on observations and varaibles of interest

- "Feature engineering"
    + Creating new variables that are functions/combinations of existing variables (e.g., computing slope from $(y_{2}-y_{_{1}})/(x_{2}-x_{_{1}})$)
- Calculating summary statistics (i.e., mean, mode)
- Dealing with "missingness"

*_Tidy + Transform = WRANGLE!_*

### How do we generate insights?

ADD IN  EMPHASIZE CYCLICAL NATURE OF THE TWO

**Visualization**

How we learn about the relationship among variables

- How strongly correlated are two variables?
- What are their distributions like?
    + Can inform viable modeling strategies

**Modeling**

Allow you to answer _specific_ questions with your data

### How do you communicate results?

- RMarkdown


ADD IN RSTUDIO - PROGRAMMING

### Tool Kit

```{r load_libs}
library(tidyverse)
#install.packages(c("nycflights13", "gapminder", "Lahman"))
library(nycflights13)
library(gapminder)
library(Lahman)
```

## Wrangle: Tidy + Transform


### Filter funs

filter_at, filter_if

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```
