Data Science Projects: Tidy Workflow Essentials

![R for Data Science _Garrett Grolemund & Hadley Wickham_](https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/571b056757d68e6df81a3e3853f54d3c76ad6efc/32d37/diagrams/data-science.png)

### What is Tidy Data?

**Tidy**

Data that is in a format optimized for visualization and modeling so that you can examine your hypotehses of interest

- Each column is a variable
- Each row is an observation

**Transform**

Further prep that allows you to narrow in on observations and varaibles of interest

- "Feature engineering"
    + Creating new variables that are functions/combinations of existing variables (e.g., computing slope from $(y_{2}-y_{_{1}})/(x_{2}-x_{_{1}})$)
- Calculating summary statistics (i.e., mean, mode)
- Dealing with "missingness"

*_Tidy + Transform = WRANGLE!_*

### How do we generate insights?

ADD IN  EMPHASIZE CYCLICAL NATURE OF THE TWO

**Visualization**

How we learn about the relationship among variables

- How strongly correlated are two variables?
- What are their distributions like?
    + Can inform viable modeling strategies

**Modeling**

Allow you to answer _specific_ questions with your data

### How do you communicate results?

**Always starts with ggplot() fxn**

ggplot()

- Creates a coordinate system that you can add layers to

**Layers**

- Use various funcitons to add _layers_ and complete your plot
    + These are the graphical visualizations of your data
    + For example, geom_line adds a layer of lines to your place, creating a linegrph of your data
    + Different geom fxns = different layers = different plots
    
**mapping argument**

- Connecting variables to visual properties of graph
    + Can be specified in each geom function OR in ggplot function
- Always paired with aes() function
    + arguements x and y specify which variables to map to the x and y axes
    
```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy))

str(mpg)
mpg %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = displ,y = hwy)) + 
  geom_point()
```

ggplot + geom is our template

```{r}
mpg %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = displ,y = hwy)) + 
  geom_point()

mpg %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = displ,y = hwy)) + 
  geom_line() 
```

**but what happened to the pipes?**

In short: 
 
- For %>% we are passing values from the left into a function on the right. For + in ggplot we are adding elements to a plot. Conceptually this is not the same as passing previous elements of a plot into a geom function.

#### You Try

ADD IN EXERCISE

- scatter plot of x vs y
- not so informative scatter plot for an x - y with a categorical variable
- plots for two categorical variables
    + geom_count
    + geom_tile

THINGS TO MENTION:

- The ggplot() function creates the background of the plot, but since no layers were specified with geom function, nothing is drawn.
- glimpse() vs nrow/ncol
- A scatter plot is not a useful display of these variables since both drv and class are categorical variables. Since categorical variables typically take a small number of values, there are a limited number of unique combinations of (x, y) values that can be displayed.
    + A simple scatter plot does not show how many observations there are for each (x, y) value. As such, scatterplots work best for plotting a continuous x and a continuous y variable, and when all (x, y) values are unique.
    
```{r}
ggplot(mpg, aes(x = class, y = drv)) +
  geom_count()
```

geom_tile and complete()
```{r}
mpg %>%
  count(class, drv) %>%
  complete(class, drv, fill = list(n = 0L)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = class, y = drv)) +
  geom_tile(mapping = aes(fill = n))
```

The complete() function in the tidyr package adds new rows to a data frame for missing combinations of columns. 

#### More on the Aesthetic Mappings 

ADD IN EXERCISE

- Using aes to explain outliers or unusual patterns 

```{r}
mpg %>% 
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, color = displ < 5)) +
  geom_point()
```
 

**mapping variables to an aesthetic**

You can add a third variable, like class, to a two dimensional scatterplot by mapping it to an aesthetic. _An aesthetic is a visual property of the objects in your plot_. Aesthetics include things like the size, the shape, or the color of your points.

**Aesthetic  = mapping between a variable and a value**

- _use aes() to associate the name of the aesthetic with a variable to display_
    + x and y locations of points are themsevles aesthetics  or visual properties that you can map to variables to display info about the data 
    + Adds legends to explain the mappings between locations/aesthetics and values
    + For x and y, the axeses lines act as legends to explain the mapping between locations and values 
- You can display a point (like the one below) in different ways by changing the values of its aesthetic properties. Since we already use the word “value” to describe data, let’s use the word “level” to describe aesthetic properties. 

```{r}
mpg %>% 
  ggplot() +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, color = class))
```

- ggplot2 will automatically assign a unique level of the aesthetic (here a unique color) to each unique value of the variable, _a process known as scaling_
- ggplot2 will also add a legend that explains which levels correspond to which values

Could've easily changed this aes to be about size vs color 


```{r}
mpg %>% 
  ggplot() +
  geom_point(aes(x = displ, y = hwy, size = class))
```

- In this case, the exact size of each point would reveal its class affiliation. 
- Need ot find the right aesthetic for the right variable

ADD IN EXAMPLES OF AESTHETICS NOT MAKING SENSE 

```{r}
mpg %>% 
  ggplot() +
  geom_point(aes(x = displ, y = hwy, alpha = class))
mpg %>% 
  ggplot() +
  geom_point(aes(x = displ, y = hwy, shape = class))
```

Good aes() options for 3rd variables:

- Good for categorical 
    + shape = (as a number, denoting type of point. search point shapes in ggplot2 for options)
- Good for categorical or continuous variables:
    + color = (character string of color or HEX code, "#66CC99"). If continuous the continuous variable uses a scale that will vary from light to dark for the color of your choice
- Good for continuous or ordered variables
    + size = (numeric, of a point in mm)
    + alpha = (numeric between new alpha level in [0,1]. If alpha is NA, existing alpha values are preserved.)

_Note_: ggplot2 will only use six shapes at a time. By default, additional groups will go unplotted when you use the shape aesthetic.

R has 25 built in shapes that are identified by numbers

![Shapes in R](https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/2705b59d57362a103f0dad04b0ccfdeff9a101d2/3dc1b/visualize_files/figure-html/shapes-1.png)

There are some seeming duplicates: for example, 0, 15, and 22 are all squares. The difference comes from the interaction of the colour and fill aesthetics. The hollow shapes (0–14) have a border determined by colour; the solid shapes (15–18) are filled with colour; the filled shapes (21–24) have _a border of colour and are filled with fill_

Note that shapes 21-24 have both stroke colour and a fill. _The size of the filled part is controlled by size, the size of the stroke is controlled by stroke_. Each is measured in mm, and the total size of the point is the sum of the two. Note that the size is constant along the diagonal in the following figure.

BORDER = COLOR (stroke)
    + size of the color/border controlled by stroke
INSIDE = FILL (size)
    + size of fill controlled by size
    
```{r}
mpg %>% 
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(color = cty)) +
  scale_colour_gradient(low = "darkolivegreen1", high = "darkolivegreen")
# remember BORDER = COLOR = STROK
    #INSIDE = FILL = SIZE
```

 Stroke changes the size of the border for shapes (21-25). These are filled shapes in which the color and size of the border can differ from that of the filled interior of the shape.
 
```{r}
ggplot(mtcars, aes(wt, mpg)) +
  geom_point(shape = 21, colour = "black", fill = "white", size = 5, stroke = 5)
```
 

**We can also set an aesthetic manually to have a particular appearance, as opposed to reflecting information about a variable. When this is done the particular aesthetic we wish to manipulate gets set by name as an argument of your _geom_ function _outside_ of the aes() function**

The argument colour = "blue" is included within the mapping argument, and as such, it is treated as an aesthetic, which is a mapping between a variable and a value. In the expression, colour = "blue", "blue" is interpreted as a categorical variable which only takes a single value "blue". If this is confusing, consider how colour = 1:234 and colour = 1 are interpreted by aes().

```{r}
mpg %>% 
  ggplot() +
  geom_point(aes(x = displ, y = hwy), shape = 0)
mpg %>% 
  ggplot() +
  geom_point(aes(x = displ, y = hwy), shape = 22, color = 'blue', fill = 'yellow')
mpg %>% 
  ggplot() +
  geom_point(aes(x = displ, y = hwy), color = 'blue')
```

#### You Try

ADD IN EXERCISE

- behavior of aesthetics for categorical vs continuous variables 
    + Instead of using discrete colors, the continuous variable uses a scale that varies from a light to dark blue color.
    + When mapped to size, the sizes of the points vary continuously as a function of their size.
    + Can't use with shape
- stroke to control color (border) size and size to control fill (inside) size

Note that shapes 21-24 have both stroke colour and a fill. The size of the filled part is controlled by size, the size of the stroke is controlled by stroke. Each is measured in mm, and the total size of the point is the sum of the two. Note that the size is constant along the diagonal in the following figure.

```{r}
sizes <- expand.grid(size = (0:3) * 2, stroke = (0:3) * 2)
ggplot(sizes, aes(size, stroke, size = size, stroke = stroke)) + 
  geom_abline(slope = -1, intercept = 6, colour = "white", size = 6) + 
  geom_point(shape = 21, fill = "red") +
  scale_size_identity()
```

- MAKE OUTLIERS CERTAIN COLOR 

```{r}
ggplot(mpg, aes(x = displ, y = hwy, colour = displ < 5)) +
  geom_point()
```


**Aesthetics can also be mapped to expressions like displ < 5**. _The ggplot() function behaves as if a temporary variable was added to the data with with values equal to the result of the expression_. In this case, the result of displ < 5 is a logical variable which takes values of TRUE or FALSE.

This also explains why, in Exercise 3.3.1, the expression colour = "blue" created a categorical variable with only one category: “blue”.

We can do this at various points. Remember geom function will inheret aes mappings unless we specify otherwise 

```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg, mapping = aes(displ, hwy)) +
  geom_point(data= filter(mpg, cyl > 4), 
             aes(displ, hwy, color = manufacturer),
             inherit.aes = FALSE) +
  geom_point(data = filter(mpg, cyl == 4), 
             aes(displ, hwy), color = "grey",
             inherit.aes = FALSE )
```


- Mapping a single variable to multiple aesthetics is redundant. Because it is redundant information, in most cases avoid mapping a single variable to multiple aesthetics.

#### Common Problems


+ sign in right place. Has to come at the end of the line not the start

#### Facets

facet_wrap 
    + single variable facet_wrap(~var)

To facet your plot on the combination of two variables, add facet_grid() to your plot call.

```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) + 
  facet_grid(drv ~ cyl)
```

If you prefer to not facet in the rows or columns dimension, use a . instead of a variable name, e.g. + facet_grid(cyl ~ .) will facet on the y-axis to create rows for cyl 


```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) + 
  facet_grid(cyl ~ .)

## if you want facets to appear as rows not columns
```

#### YOU TRY

ADD IN EXERCISE

THINGS TO MENTION:

Using facet_wrap with two variables to create 1 facet per combination. combine with labeller

```{r}
ggplot(mpg, aes(displ, hwy)) +
  geom_point() +
  facet_wrap(c("cyl", "drv"), labeller = "label_both")

### TREATED THEM AS TWO FACETS 
ggplot(mpg, aes(displ, hwy)) +
  geom_point() +
  facet_grid(cyl ~ drv, labeller = "label_both")
```

**When using facet_grid() you should usually put the variable with more unique levels in the columns. Why?**
There will be more space for columns if the plot is laid out horizontally (landscape).

It is difficult to handle overlapping points with color. Jittering will still work with color. But jittering will only work well if there are few points and the classes do not overlap much, otherwise, the colors of areas will no longer be distinct, and it will be hard to pick out the patterns of different categories visually. Transparency (alpha) does not work well with colors since the mixing of overlapping transparent colors will no longer represent the colors of the categories. Binning methods use already color to encode density, so color cannot be used to encode categories.

Facet over color

- The benefits encoding a variable through facetting over color become more advantageous as either the number of points or the number of categories increase. In the former, as the number of points increases, there is likely to be more overlap.

- More than 9 categories? Color is hard to see, especially with increasing numbe rof points
- Disadvantages: can be harder to compare values of observations across categories

#### geometric objects 3.6


```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg) +
  geom_smooth(aes(x = displ, y = hwy))
```

Using line type for cateogircal variables 

```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_smooth(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, linetype = drv))
```


**GROUPING AESTHETIC**

```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg) +
  geom_smooth(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, group = drv))

ggplot(mpg) +
  geom_smooth(mapping = aes(displ, hwy, color = drv), show.legend = FALSE)
```

Many geoms, like geom_smooth(), use a single geometric object to display multiple rows of data. For these geoms, you can set the group aesthetic to a categorical variable to draw multiple objects. 

**set group aesthetic to a categorical variable to draw multiple objects for each unique value of the grouping variable. **

- Like using color, shape, or linetype but does NOT add a legend or distinguishing feature to each geom (just an additional identical object taking on the values of the given grouping)


**Layering geoms**

GEOMS INHERIT AES OBJECTS FROM GGPLOT FUNCTION 

You can avoid this type of repetition by passing a set of mappings to ggplot(). ggplot2 will treat these mappings as global mappings that apply to each geom in the graph.

```{r}
ggplot(mpg) + 
  geom_smooth(aes(displ, hwy, linetype  = drv, color = drv)) +
  geom_point(aes(displ, hwy, color = drv),
             inherit.aes = FALSE)

# OR 
ggplot(mpg, aes(displ, hwy)) + 
  geom_smooth(aes(linetype  = drv, color = drv)) +
  geom_point(aes(color = drv))

ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) +
  geom_smooth(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy))

#OR 

ggplot(mpg, aes(displ,hwy)) + 
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth()

ggplot(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(color = class)) + 
  geom_smooth()
```

**Error: ggplot2 doesn't know how to deal with data of class uneval** 

- ggplot can't interpert the argument value appropriately
- if you place additional mapping in a geom fxn ggplot2 will treat them as lcoal mapping for that layer.  It will use these mappings to extend or overwrite the global mappings for that layer only. This makes it possible to display different aesthetics in different layers.

_Use the same idea to specify different data for each layer_

HERE THE LOCAL DATA ARGUMENT IN GEOM_SMOOTH OVERRRIDES THE GLOBAL DATA ARGUMENT IN GGPLOT FOR THE SMOOTH LAYER ONLY

```{r}

ggplot(data = mpg, mapping = aes(displ, hwy)) +
  geom_smooth(data = filter(mpg, class == 'subcompact'), se = FALSE) +
  geom_point(aes(color = class))

#forgot aes in geom_point and got error
# Error in rep(value[[k]], length.out = n) : 
#   attempt to replicate an object of type 'builtin'
```
 

**Geometric objects for representing the data**

- not every aesthetic works with every geom

ggplot2 provides over 30 geoms, and extension packages provide even more (see https://www.ggplot2-exts.org for a sampling). 

#### YOU TRY

less used

```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg, mapping = aes(class,hwy)) +
  geom_boxplot()

p <- ggplot(mpg, aes(class, hwy))
p + geom_boxplot()
p + geom_boxplot() + geom_jitter(width = 0.2)
p + geom_boxplot() + coord_flip()

# Use larger width/height to completely smooth away discreteness
ggplot(mpg, aes(cty, hwy)) + geom_jitter()
ggplot(mpg, aes(cty, hwy)) + geom_jitter(width = 0.5, height = 0.5)

```

The point geom is used to create scatterplots. The scatterplot is most useful for displaying the relationship between two continuous variables. It can be used to compare one continuous and one categorical variable, or two categorical variables, but a variation like geom_jitter, geom_count, or geom_bin2d is usually more appropriate.

REVIEW EXAMPLES OF LESS USED GEOMS

geom_area 

Stacked area chart are often use to represent time series. These examples are inspired from the cookbook for R. Check the dataviz catalog to better understand what is a stacked area graph! Let’s build some data for the next examples

```{r}

# DATAOR
set.seed(345)
Sector <- rep(c("S01","S02","S03","S04","S05","S06","S07"),times=7)
Year <- as.numeric(rep(c("1950","1960","1970","1980","1990","2000","2010"),each=7))
Value <- runif(49, 10, 100)
data <- data.frame(Sector,Year,Value)


ggplot(data, aes(x=Year, y=Value, fill=Sector)) + 
    geom_area()

```

?layer_data

#### Statistical Transformations

**Some graphs calculate new values to plot, like count in geom_bar**

geom_bar makes the height of the bar proportional to the number of cases in each group (or if the weight aethetic is supplied, the sum of the weights). If you want the heights of the bars to represent values in the data, use geom_col instead. geom_bar uses stat_count by default: it counts the number of cases at each x position. geom_col uses stat_identity: it leaves the data as is.

```{r}
glimpse(diamonds)
ggplot(data = diamonds) + 
  geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = cut))
```

- bar charts, histograms, and frequency polygons bin your data and then plot bin counts, the number of points that fall in each bin.
- smoothers fit a model to your data and then plot predictions from the model.
- boxplots compute a robust summary of the distribution and then display a specially formatted box

**algorithm use to calculate these new values referred to as a stat**

- geom then uses the transformed data and new values/calculated stat var to build the plot

YOU CAN USE GEOMS AND STATS INTERCHANGEABLE ACTUALLY 

- _This works because every geom has a default stat and every stat has a default geom_

```{r}
ggplot(data = diamonds) +
  stat_count(mapping = aes(x = cut))
```

**THREE REASONS YOU NEED TO USE A STAT EXPLICITLY**

- override the default stat
- overrride default mapping from newly computed variables in stat to the aesthetics
    + For example you want a barchart of proportions vs count 
- to draw greater attention to the statistical transformation in your code
    + For example you might use stat_summary(), which summarises the y values for each unique x value, to draw attention to the summary that you’re computing:

override default from stat_count to stat_identity

```{r}
diamonds %>% 
  count(cut) %>% 
  ggplot() + 
  geom_bar(aes(cut,n), stat = 'identity')
```

override mapping of newly computer variables from stat fxn to aesthetics to show proportion vs count in bar chart

```{r}
ggplot(data = diamonds) + 
  geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = cut, y = ..prop.., group = 1))
```

draw greater attention to stats used - show multiple computer stats 

```{r}
ggplot(data = diamonds) + 
  stat_summary(
    mapping = aes(x = cut, y = depth),
    fun.ymin = min,
    fun.ymax = max,
    fun.y = median
  )

ggplot(data = mpg) +
  stat_summary(
    mapping = aes(class, hwy),
    fun.ymax = max,
    fun.ymin = min,
    fun.y = median,
    na.rm = TRUE
  )
```

#### YOU TRY

REWRITE THE ABOVE USING THE GEOM INSTEAD OF STAT

```{r}
ggplot(data = diamonds) + 
  stat_summary(
    mapping = aes(x = cut, y = depth),
    fun.ymin = min,
    fun.ymax = max,
    fun.y = median
  )


```

ARGUMENTS TO THE PAIRED GEOM/STAT get passed to the geom layer, inside the geom function outside the aes function

Most geoms and stats come in pairs that are almost always used in concert. Read through the documentation and make a list of all the pairs. What do they have in common?

**In our proportion bar chart, we need to set group = 1. Why? In other words what is the problem with these two graphs?**
```{r}
ggplot(data = diamonds) + 
  geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = cut, y = ..prop..))
ggplot(data = diamonds) + 
  geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = cut, y = ..prop.., group = 1))
```

If group = 1 is not included, then all the bars in the plot will have the same height, a height of 1. **The function geom_bar() assumes that the groups are equal to the x values since the stat computes the counts within the group. BUT when we are showing proportion.. we want this group to be across all x values,**

The problem with these two plots is that the proportions are calculated within the groups.

**With the fill aesthetic, the heights of the bars need to be normalized.**
```{r}
ggplot(data = diamonds) +
  geom_bar(aes(x = cut, y = ..count.. / sum(..count..), fill = color))
```

  )

### R Markdown 

Designed to be used in 3 ways: 

- Analyst to analyst
  + Notebook mode
- Analyst to decision maker
    + Report mode
- Environment to do data science and capture thought process

R Markdown integrates a number of R packages and external tools. This means that help is, by-and-large, not available through ?. Instead, as you work through this chapter, and use R Markdown in the future, keep these resources close to hand:

- R Markdown Cheat Sheet: Help > Cheatsheets > R Markdown Cheat Sheet,
- R Markdown Reference Guide: Help > Cheatsheets > R Markdown Reference Guide.

**You need the rmarkdown package, but you don’t need to explicitly install it or load it, as RStudio automatically does both when needed.**

#### Basics 

R Markdown file = PLAIN TEXT FILE that has an extension .Rmd
Notebook interface where code and output are interleaed

R Markdown contains 3 types of content

YAML HEADER - CODE CHUNKS- TEXT

1. An optional YAML header surrounded by --- s
    + Yet another markdown language
2. Chunks of R code surrounded by ```
3. Text mixed with simple text formatting like # heading and _italics_.

When you knit the document, R Markdown sends the .Rmd file to knitr, http://yihui.name/knitr/, which executes all of the code chunks and creates a new markdown (.md) document which includes the code and its output. The markdown file generated by knitr is then processed by pandoc, http://pandoc.org/, which is responsible for creating the finished file. The advantage of this two step workflow is that you can create a very wide range of output formats, as you’ll learn about in R markdown formats.

![R Markdown workflow](https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/61d189fd9cdf955058415d3e1b28dd60e1bd7c9b/9791d/images/rmarkdownflow.png)

**TWO STEP PROCESS OF knitr --> pandoc allows you to create a wide range of output formats

#### YOUR TRY 

PREVIEW vs KNIT

  - PREVIEW DOESN'T RUN ANY R CODE CHUNKS. Instead output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed
  - The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor.

NOTEBOOK VS MARKDOWN 

**R notebook files show the output of code chunks inside the editor, while hiding the console, when they are edited in RStudio. This contrasts with R markdown files, which show their output inside the console, and do not show output inside the editor**. _This makes R notebook documents appealing for interactive exploration_. In this R markdown file, the plot is displayed in the “Plot” tab, while the output of summary() is displayed in the tab.

BOTH NOTEBOOK AND R MARKDOWN FILES CAN BE

- knit to produce HTML output

ONLY R MARKDOWN CAN BE

- knit to a variety of formats, HTML, PDF, DOCX
    + vs. notebooks can only be knit to HTML files which are given the extension .nb.html
    + However, unlike R markdown files knit to HTML, **the HTML output of an R notebook includes copy of the original .Rmd source. If a .nb.html file is opened in RStudio, the source of the .Rmd file can be extracted and edited.** there is no way to recover the original source of an R markdown file from its output, except through the parts that are displayed in the output itself.
    
**CHANGE OUTPUT by changing the value of the output key in the YAML header**
